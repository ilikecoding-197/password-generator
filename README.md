# password-generator
A password generator written in Python.

**This is my first real project, so any help is *welcome.***

## Description
I made this because i just wanted to learn Git and how to use it. I am also doing this entirety in the browser, including the code itself. I am **NOT** getting deep inside the command line.

## How to use
Simply, either use the libary, or the main program.
